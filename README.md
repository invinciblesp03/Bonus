In this video I have solved a very minor programming question which is given below.
Question: A company decided to give bonus of 5% to employee if his/her year of service is more than 5 years. Ask user for their salary and year of service and print the net bonus amount. 

To solve this question, I have used C++ programming language.

Motive for this video: This video was created to practice programming as well as learn how to record the video and post it to youtube,
